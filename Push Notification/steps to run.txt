go to the folder location where firebase.json is location
type firebase serve - this will start the server

if any changes are done in index.html, use deploy command

so open the url in chrome you may have to allow notification browser else notification wont be shown
so do this in the browser:
chrome://flags/#enable-native-notifications
and enable Enable native notifications ((Mac, Linux)
Enable support for using the native notification toasts and notification center on platforms where these are available)
