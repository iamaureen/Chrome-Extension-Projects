## Installation Phase
1. Install node.js

2. Go to cmd

2.i. npm install -g firebase-tools
2.ii. firebase login
<src: https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started>

## Firebase setup phase
3. Go to desired folder for the projects, open cmd

4. firebase init => it will create firebase.json

<followed this tutorial for push notification among browsers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdzXaW8IbBM>

5.Steps: (in the cmd prompt navigated to the project folder that was initiated as Firebase)
5.a. select the Firebase CLI features needed for this directory
<use space to select, and finally press enter>

5.b. select the Firebase project for this directory
<list is shown from the firebase console, select the one associated with it>

5.c. What file should be used for Database Rules? database.rules.json
<Database Rules for <project> will be downloaded to database.rules.json.
Future modifications to database.rules.json will update database rules when "firebase deploy" is executed.

5.d. Functions Setup: A functions directory will be created in the project with a Node.js
package pre-configured. Functions can be deployed with a ifrebase deply cmd
<will write functions/package.json
will write functions/index.js>
Do you want to install dependencies with npm now? (Y/N) Y
will install dependencies in node_modules

5.e. Hosting Setup:
What do you want to use as your public directory? (public) . (. means root folder)

5.f. Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? NO

5.g. File ./index.html already exists. Overwrite? No

<By this end, Firebase initialization should be completed>

6. These steps have created a folder/file structure
## File Descriptions:
<src: https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started>
myproject
 +- .firebaserc    # Hidden file that helps you quickly switch between
 |                 # projects with `firebase use`
 |
 +- firebase.json  # Describes properties for your project
 |
 +- functions/     # Directory containing all your functions code
      |
      +- package.json  # npm package file describing your Cloud Functions code
      |
      +- index.js      # main source file for your Cloud Functions code
      |
      +- node_modules/ # directory where your dependencies (declared in
                       # package.json) are installed


7. To deploy hosting:
firebase deploy --only hosting
<hosts the app and gives an url>

8. a.To deploy functions:
firebase deploy --only functions

8. b. To deploy specific functions:
firebase deploy --only function:<function name from index.js>
example firbase deploy --only function:sendNotifications

9. After deploying, firebase CLI outputs the URL for any HTTP function endpoints
